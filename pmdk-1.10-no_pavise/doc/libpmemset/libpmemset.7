.SH NAME
.PP
\f[B]libpmemset\f[] \- provides core functionality any persistent
application should reasonably have (EXPERIMENTAL)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
#include\ <libpmemset.h>
cc\ ...\ \-lpmemset\ \-lpmem2
\f[]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[B]libpmemset\f[] is still in progress.
.SH DEBUGGING
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]PMEMSET_LOG_LEVEL\f[]
.PP
Value assigned to the \f[B]PMEMSET_LOG_LEVEL\f[] controls the level of
log details presented in the debug version of the library, as follows:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]0\f[] \- This is the default level of logging, when
\f[B]PMEMSET_LOG_LEVEL\f[] is not set.
No log messages are presented at this level.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]1\f[] \- Additional details on any errors detected are logged, in
addition to returning the \f[I]errno\f[]\-based errors as usual.
The same information may be retrieved using \f[B]pmemset_errormsg\f[]().
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]2\f[] \- A trace of basic operations is logged.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]3\f[] \- Enables a very verbose amount of function call tracing in
the library.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]4\f[] \- Enables voluminous and fairly obscure tracing information
that is likely only useful to the \f[B]libpmemset\f[] developers.
.PP
Unless \f[B]PMEMSET_LOG_FILE\f[] is set, debugging output is written to
\f[I]stderr\f[].
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]PMEMSET_LOG_FILE\f[]
.PP
Specifies the name of a file where all logging information should be
written.
If \f[B]PMEMSET_LOG_FILE\f[] is not set, output is written to
\f[I]stderr\f[].
